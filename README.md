# 3D Render - Java

A project focused on designing, modeling, and rendering a virtual 3-dimensional graphical scene. It incorporates various physics aspects such as light sources, rays, reflections, refractions, color, and occlusions. The project adheres to principles of software engineering, Agile Software Development, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and various design patterns. Additionally, unit tests are written using JUnit as part of a test-driven design approach.

## Features

- **3D Scene Rendering:** Design and render complex 3D scenes with realistic physics.
- **Physics Simulation:** Simulate light sources, rays, reflections, refractions, color, and occlusions.
- **Software Engineering Practices:** Follow principles of software engineering, Agile, and OOP.
- **Design Patterns:** Implement various design patterns for efficient and maintainable code.
- **Test-Driven Design:** Write and maintain unit tests using JUnit.
